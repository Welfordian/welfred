# Welfred - MacOS

This is an Alfred clone writted in NodeJS with Electron.

This really wasn't created to be used by anyone or for anyone to look at the ugly, horrible mess of code, I just needed somewhere to store it.

Welfred is not able to list applications on Windows. This currently only works on MacOS as Windows is awful and should never be used. 

This application is also capable of loading plugins (stored in the `~/.welfred/plugins` directory).

Two example plugins (YouTube Mini Player & Spotify Control) can b**e downloaded from the preferences menu.
